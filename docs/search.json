    "text": "Warm up\nBefore we introduce the data, let’s warm up with some simple exercises.\n\nThe top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\nYAML\nOpen the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nThen go to the Git pane in your RStudio.\nIf you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes. If you’re happy with these changes, write “Update author name” in the Commit message box and hit Commit.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\nPushing changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to the web! Or more specifically, to your repo on GitHub. Why? So that others can see your changes. And by others, we mean the course teaching team (your repos in this course are private to you and us, only).\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, click on Push. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password. This might feel cumbersome. Bear with me… We will teach you how to save your password so you don’t have to enter it every time. But for this one assignment you’ll have to manually enter each time you push in order to gain some experience with it."

Actually, this single data frame contains 13 datasets, designed to show us why data visualisation is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading. The different datasets are marked by the dataset variable.\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: ?datasaurus_dozen.

It contains data on how fast guinea pigs’ teeth grow if you give them vitamin C supplements in various forms and at various doses. You can learn more about this dataset by typing ?ToothGrowth at the console.\n\nLet’s take a look:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nglimpse(ToothGrowth)\n\nRows: 60\nColumns: 3\n$ len  <dbl> 4.2, 11.5, 7.3, 5.8, 6.4, 10.0, 11.2, 11.2, 5.2, 7.0, 16.5, 16.5,…\n$ supp <fct> VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, VC, V…\n$ dose <dbl> 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, …\n\nsummary(ToothGrowth)\n\n      len        supp         dose      \n Min.   : 4.20   OJ:30   Min.   :0.500  \n 1st Qu.:13.07   VC:30   1st Qu.:0.500  \n Median :19.25           Median :1.000  \n Mean   :18.81           Mean   :1.167  \n 3rd Qu.:25.27           3rd Qu.:2.000  \n Max.   :33.90           Max.   :2.000  \n\n\nHmm…the dose column looks a little funny. There are only three dosage values [0.5, 1 ,2], but R is interpreting them as continuous. We can tell R that we want to convert them to categories (a.k.a. factors) using dplyr like this:\n\nToothGrowth <- ToothGrowth %>%\n  mutate(dose = factor(dose))\n\nNow let’s look again:\n\nsummary(ToothGrowth)\n\n      len        supp     dose   \n Min.   : 4.20   OJ:30   0.5:20  \n 1st Qu.:13.07   VC:30   1  :20  \n Median :19.25           2  :20  \n Mean   :18.81                   \n 3rd Qu.:25.27                   \n Max.   :33.90                   \n\n\nMuch better!
