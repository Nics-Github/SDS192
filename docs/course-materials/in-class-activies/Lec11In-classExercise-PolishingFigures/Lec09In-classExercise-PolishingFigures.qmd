# Step 1: Load Packages

Load the package and the dataset we need to work on our analysis today.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

schedule <- read_csv("data/schedule.csv")
```

# Step 2: View the Data Frames

```{r}
# Write your code below

```

# Step 3: Create a Barplot Visualizing the Frequency of Each Activity

> How many times does each activity show up in the table?

```{r}
# Write your code below

```

# Step 4: Reorder the x-axis of Your Previous Plot

I want to reorder my x-axis, so I will place the `reorder()` function around my x aesthetic, and assign the following arguments:

* the values to be reordered: `activity`
* the values will serve as the basis for reordering: `activity`
* and a function to determine how values will be reordered: `length`

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

``` 

# Step 5: Create a Barplot Visualizing the Time Spent on Each Activity

```{r}
# Write your code below

``` 

# Step 6: Reorder the x-axis of Your Previous Plot

I want to reorder my x-axis, so I will place the `reorder()` function around my x aesthetic, and assign the following arguments:

* the values to be reordered: `activity`
* the values will serve as the basis for reordering: `hours`
* and a function to determine how values will be reordered: `sum`

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

``` 

# Step 7: Create Grouped Boxplots Visualizing the Time Spent on Each Activity

Use the `coord_flip()` function to flip the x-axis and the y-axis. Also, be sure to add labels to your plot.

```{r}
# Write your code below

``` 

# Step 8: Reorder the x-axis of Your Previous Plot

I want to reorder my x-axis, so I will place the `reorder()` function around my x aesthetic, and assign the following arguments:

* the values to be reordered: `activity`
* the values will serve as the basis for reordering: `hours`
* and a function to determine how values will be reordered: `median`

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

```
