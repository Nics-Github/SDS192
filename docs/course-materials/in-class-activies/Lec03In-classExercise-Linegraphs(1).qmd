# MDSR 3.5 Problem 1

[Angelica Schuyler Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_Schuyler_Church) (1756â€“1814) was the daughter of New York Governer Philip Schuyler and sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. Angelica, New York was named after her. Using the `babynames` package generate a plot of the reported proportion of babies born with the name Angelica over time and interpret the figure. 

# Step 1: Load Packages

Load the package and the dataset we need to work on our analysis today.

```{r}


```

# Step 2: View the Data

```{r}
# Write your code below to check the column names for babynames

```

# Step 3: Filter a Baby Name

To find information about a specific name, we use the `filter()` function. (You don't need to worry about this now. We'll cover this later in this course.)

```{r}
angelica <- filter(babynames, name == "Angelica")
```

# Step 4: Create a Linegraph Using the `ggplot()` Function

```{r}
# Write your code below

```

**Discussion**: How do you interpret this linegraph you have created?
