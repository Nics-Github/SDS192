# Do not edit this code block/chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

## Step 1: Load Packages

Load the package and the dataset we need to work on our analysis today.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

## Step 2: View the Data Frames

The `gapminder` package includes a data frame called `gapminder`, containing information about different countries from 1952 to 2007.

```{r}
# Write your code below

```

We're going to only focus on data for 2007 and save this in a new data frame `gapminder_2007`. We use data wrangling code from the `tidyverse` package. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense for now, we'll cover data wrangling later in this course. For now, run the following code:

```{r}
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007)
```

An alternative method for exploring a data frame is by using the `glipmse()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder_2007)
```

This data is in fact the same data as in Table 2.1 of ModernDive.

## Step 3: Recreate Figure 2.1 in ModernDive but with No Color and No Size

Here's [Figure 2.1](https://moderndive.com/ModernDive_files/figure-html/gapminder-1.png)

```{r}
# Write your code below

```

## Step 4: Add LOESS Smoother Layer with `geom_smooth()`

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

```

## Step 5: Remove Standard Error Bars by Setting `se = FALSE`

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

```

## Step 6: Change Span of "smoothing" Window by Changing the Value of Span

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

```

## Step 7: Force Line to Be Straight. i.e. Linear Regression

```{r}
# Paste the code below and adjust it

```
