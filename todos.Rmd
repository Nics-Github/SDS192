This is a list of things I should change be for spring. 

1. Update lab 1 github. I think there are easier ways to get on github 
2. Update format options for lab 2 and 3 (I'm doing the other ones as I go.)
3. Update link for project 1.
4. For ethics lecture. 
-   Add a bit about hiring bias based on the open intro data
-   facial recognition bias
