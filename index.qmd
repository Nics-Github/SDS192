rendering:

-   Note on `#| eval: FALSE` in lab 4 (due Friday)

gitignore:

If you tried to push the `sqf_2011.csv` to github you probably got an error.

-   First save your qmd somewhere.

-   Uncommit your commit with `git reset --hard HEAD^` or `git reset --hard HEAD~2`

-   You may need to add a `.gitignore` file.

-   Open `.gitignore` and add `sqf_2011.csv` to it.
