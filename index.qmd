# Day 20 Cleaning

Warm up: table2

Let's clean up `billboard`

# Day 19 Tidy Data

Chapter 5 problem 4 solutions

#### 4a The oldest plane to fly from NYC is a Douglas with tailnum:

```{r A-solution-to-problem-4}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

library(nycflights13)
planes |> inner_join(flights, by = "tailnum") |>
  arrange(year.x) |>
  filter(tailnum == "N381AA") |>
  select(tailnum)|>
  head(1)


```

#### 4b The number of planes included in planes that flew from NYC is: 

```{r solution-to-4b}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

library(nycflights13)
planes |> inner_join(flights, by = "tailnum") |>
  count(tailnum) |>

# Day 18 Wrangling Practice

```{r code-baby-names}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true

#This makes the Random_subset for problem 1
Random_subset <- babynames %>%

```

We'll do Problems [Chapter 4: 1,2,5,9,(12)](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/04-dataI.html#dataI-exercises) in class today. [Chapter 5: 3,4](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/05-joins.html#join-exercises)

# Day 17 Joining tables

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# lab 4 submission issues

If you tried to push the `sqf_2011.csv` to github you probably got an error.

First save your qmd somewhere.

Uncommit your commit with `git reset --hard HEAD^` or `git reset --hard HEAD~2`

You may need to add a `.gitignore` file.

Open `.gitignore` and add `sqf_2011.csv` to it.

Exploration: how to join tables?

# Day 16 Lab 4

[Here is the link](https://classroom.github.com/a/lx2O7eFi) for Lab 4.

Lab 4 will be due Friday by midnight.

# Day 14 Wrangling

Reminder: Rendered Project 1 due today.

[Stop and Frisk Wrangling](/course-materials/lectures/Wrangling_1_SQF.qmd)

# Day 13 Project 1

Today we are working on project 1.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# notes on rendering

-   Don't forget to render

-   The hash-pipe `#|`

-   echo, include, execute, R markdown cheat sheet.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# terminal work

-   This is a helpful website: `https://ioflood.com/blog/solved-git-error-you-have-divergent-branches-and-need-to-specify-how-to-reconcile-them/`

-   Some times you get "you have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them"

-   In terminal: `git config pull.ff only`

-   Sometimes fast forwarding is fatal.Try Merge Commit:

-   In terminal: `git checkout branch-name` then `git merge --no-ff -m "commit name" branch-name`

-   You can also try following the instructions git gives.

-   Nothing wrong with saving your code and deleting the branch. Branches are disposable.

-   You can work in a branch with lots of commmits before you push. Once you merge a pull request delete the branch.

-   Once you delete a branch on github don't work in it any more. do: `git fetch --prune` to remove the old remote branches from rstudio.Or `git branch -d branch_name` to delete your old branch
:::

# Day 12 Project 1

Today we are working on project 1.

(We will not normally have this much time to work on projects in class).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Think about Project 1

-   Consider the ethics.

-   Consider code layout. Lots of space and arguments on different lines.

-   Do at least one push on the project in class today.

-   In general lots of little pushes.

-   Make your graph legible to the lay person (title, labels, source, captions).

-   You might realize you are sharing an API key. Consider what that means.

# Day 11 Github and Ethics

# Day 10 Lab 3

Lab 3 is due next Wednesday by midnight.

# Lab 3 pitfalls

**You will be asked for a URI** enter this: `http://localhost:1410/`

Step 5: part 3. To set the line color do color="green"

For some notes on skew: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness

Remember geom_bar() counts whatever variable you give it for x.

reorder(categorical_var, numeric variable, function for reordering)

We'll discuss ethics Monday, read chapter 8.

# Lab 2 is Due

Check comments for Lab 1. Grades on moodle shortly

Due tonight by midnight.

Let's clean up our lab 2 code. This will make it easier for the grader to read.

Let's consider how we view the code. Maybe use `glimpse()` or `head()` instead of just typing `ne_county_health_2021`
