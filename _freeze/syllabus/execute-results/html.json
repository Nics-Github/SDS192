The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the concepts of data science early in their college education. In this course, students will learn to code in R or Python, popular programming languages commonly used in Data Science. This course can also be seen as an introduction to programming languages and coding. It is designed to be accessible to students from a wide range of backgrounds and interests, including those without advanced mathematics or computer programming experience.\n\nPrerequisite(s): MTH 085 or MTH 099 or MTH 011/MTH 012 with a grade of C- or better; or SM08, or adequate score on the Mathematics Placement Examination.  No computer language experience necessary but student must have a willingness to learn to code.\n\n**3 Class Hours 3 Credits**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# BASIC OUTLINE OF COURSE CONTENT:\n\n-   Introduction to Programming Language for Data Science (R or Python) and Computing Environment (RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)\n\n-   Data Science Life Cycle \n\n-   Grammar of Graphics\n\n-   Data Visualization\n\n-   Data Wrangling\n\n-   Data Collection\n\n-   Web Scraping and Importing Data\n\n-   Data Management\n\n-   Data Ethics\n\n-   Introduction to Database Querying with SQL\n\n-   Further Topics based on time and student interest may include:\n\n    -   Iteration\n\n    -   Dynamic and Customized Data Graphics\n\n    -   Geospatial Data and Maps\n\n    -   Text Mining\n\n    -   Introduction to Machine Learning (to motivate interest in an Intro to Data Science 2 course that would be devoted to this.)\n\n# Student Learning outcomes\n\nStudents who complete this course will be able to: \n\n-   Develop skills in using modern technology to conduct data analysis.\n\n-   Draw meaningful conclusions and insights from real world data. \n\n-   Understand data collection from various sources and appropriate data management. \n\n-   Effectively organize, clean, prepare data for analysis\n\n-   Communicate clear, meaningful data visualizations.\n\n-   Develop understanding and appreciation of ethics in Data Science.\n\n# Lecture schedule\n\nThe lecture schedule and associated readings can be found on the [main page](./index.html) of this course webpage. The Modern Data Science with R textbook is accessible on the navigational bar of this webpage.\n\n# Class norms {#policies}\n\n-   You are expected to stay until the end of lecture. If you need to leave early, please confirm with me at the beginning of lecture and sit somewhere where your departure will be minimally disruptive.\n-   Attendance will not be explicitly taken and occasional absences are excused. However, extended absences should be mentioned to me.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Evaluation\n\nAll due dates can be found on the [main page](./index.html) of this course webpage.\n\nThis class is project based. As such your evaluations will be based on projects you create.\n\n## Projects 40%\n\nThere are four projects to complete during the semester.\n\n## Final project 20%\n\nThere will be a final project due the last day of classes. You'll do this final project in groups of 2-3 where you can choose your groupmates.\n\n## Problem sets 25%\n\nHomework will be assigned weekly, its important to complete and stay on top of homework.\n\n## Engagment 15% {#engagement}\n\nIt is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes \"an engaged student,\" so instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get out of this class as much as you put in*. That being said, here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged in this class:\n\n-   In particular: Peer evaluations for all projects.\n-   Asking and answering questions in class.\n-   Working and staying focused in class.\n-   Coming to office hours.\n-   Posting questions on Slack.\n-   Even better: Responding to questions on Slack.\n\n## Policies\n\n1.  **Collaboration**: While I encourage you to work with your peers for problem sets, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged in your submissions.\n2.  **Honor Code**: All your work must follow the [Smith College Academic Honor Code Statement](https://www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/socialconduct/honorcode.php){target=\"_blank\"}; in particular all external sources must be cited in your submissions. <!--\n                            1. **Problem sets**:\n                                + No extensions on problem sets. However, only top 5 out of 7 scores count for your grade.\n                            1. **Mini-projects**:\n                                + Extensions only with a dean's note.\n                            1. **Midterms**:\n                                + No make-up midterms will be allowed without a dean's note. \n                                + Timestamps for all midterms will be strictly enforced.\n                            -->\n3.  **Grading**: I reserve the right to not discuss any grading issues in class and instead direct you to office hours.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#  {#accommodations}\n",
