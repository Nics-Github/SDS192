Students learn how to scrape, process and clean data from the web; manipulate data in a variety of formats; contextualize variation in data; construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques; visualize multidimensional data; design accurate, clear and appropriate data graphics; create data maps and perform basic spatial analysis; and query large relational databases. SDS 100 is required for students who have not previously completed SDS 201, SDS 220, SDS 290 or SDS 291.\n\n**4 Class Hours 4 Credits**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# BASIC OUTLINE OF COURSE CONTENT:\n\n-   Introduction to Programming Language for Data Science (R or Python) and Computing Environment (RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)\n\n-   Data Science Life Cycle\n\n-   Grammar of Graphics\n\n-   Data Visualization\n\n-   Data Wrangling\n\n-   Data Collection\n\n-   Web Scraping and Importing Data\n\n-   Data Management\n\n-   Data Ethics\n\n-   Iteration\n\n-   Introduction to Database Querying with SQL\n\n-   Further Topics based on time and student interest may include:\n\n    -   Dynamic and Customized Data Graphics\n\n    -   Geospatial Data and Maps\n\n    -   Learning with AI\n\n# Student Learning outcomes\n\nStudents who complete this course will be able to:\n\n-   Develop skills in using modern technology to conduct data analysis.\n\n-   Draw meaningful conclusions and insights from real world data.\n\n-   Understand data collection from various sources and appropriate data management.\n\n-   Effectively organize, clean, prepare data for analysis\n\n-   Communicate clear, meaningful data visualizations.\n\n-   Develop understanding and appreciation of ethics in Data Science.\n\n# Lecture schedule\n\nThe lecture schedule and associated readings can be found on the [main page](https://nics-github.github.io/MTH_190_Intro_to_DS/) of this course webpage.\n\n# Book and software\n\nThe Modern Data Science with R **textbook** is accessible on the navigational bar of this webpage as well as via [this link](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/). Students will use a local install or RStudio workbench to do computations in R find it [here](https://rstudio.smith.edu).\n\n# Class norms {#policies}\n\n-   You are expected to stay until the end of lecture. If you need to leave early, please confirm with me at the beginning of lecture and sit somewhere where your departure will be minimally disruptive.\n-   *Attendance policy.* You may be dropped from the course for missing 3 or more days of class.\n-   Attendance will not be explicitly taken and occasional absences are excused. However, extended absences should be mentioned to me.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Readings\n\nWe'll be reading chapters 1-6,8,15,and 17 of Modern Data Science with R. Probably other texts.\n\n# Evaluation\n\nAll due dates can be found on the [main page](../index.html) of this course webpage.\n\nThis class is project based. As such your evaluations will be based on projects you create.\n\n## Projects 40%\n\nThere are four projects to complete during the semester. They will be completed collaboratively with a team of students using SCRUM.\n\n## Final project 20%\n\nThere will be a final project due the last day of classes. You'll complete this final project over the course of the semester using a process called SCRUM. The Final Project will also have in groups of 2-3 where you can choose your groupmates.\n\n## Problem sets 25%\n\nHomework will be assigned regularly, its important to complete and stay on top of the problem sets. They will be graded on the following scale:\n\n-   5 points: Assignment is complete, mostly correct, rendered and submitted\n\n-   4 points: Assignment is nearly complete, mostly correct, rendered and submitted\n\n-   3 points: Assignment is around 50% of the problems have been completed, are correct, the assignment is rendered\n\n-   2 points: Assignment is at most 50% complete, the problems are incorrect and is not correctly rendered\n\n-   1 point : Assignment is largely unfinished and is not rendered\n\n-   0 points: No assignment is turned in.\n\n## Engagement 15% {#engagement}\n\nIt is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes \"an engaged student,\" so instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get out of this class as much as you put in*. That being said, here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged in this class:\n\n-   In particular: Participation in all SCRUM Sprints\n-   Asking and answering questions in class.\n-   Working and staying focused in class.\n-   Coming to office hours.\n-   Posting questions on Slack.\n-   Even better: Responding to questions on Slack.\n\n## Tentative Assignment schedule\n\nHomework will be assigned regularly and due by midnight the following Monday.\n\nProject 1- due after reading chapter 4 of MDSR roughly the 10th day of class\n\nProject 2- due after reading chapter 5 of MDSR roughly the 18th day of class\n\nProject 3- due after reading chapter 15 of MDSR roughly the 22nd day of class\n\nProject 4- due after reading chapter 17 of MDSR roughly the 26th day of class\n\nFinal Project/ Presentation during our final time.\n\nFor a more up to date schedule see the course's [website](../index.html).\n\n## Policies\n\n### Accommodation\n\nSmith is committed to providing support

meet your accommodations. \n\nIf you are unable to attend class for any reason, please follow the materials on the course website and check with another student about what happened in class. \n\n### Collaboration\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete labs, and prepare for exams.\nHowever, **all work that you submit for credit must be your own**.\nCopying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or *blocks of code* from another student or from online sources is not acceptable and will receive no credit.\nNo interaction with anyone but the instructors is allowed on any exams or quizzes.\n:::\n\n### Academic Honor Code Statement\n\nAll students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code, which Smith has had since 1944.\n\n> Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations.\n> Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.\n\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n### Code of Conduct {#conduct}\n\nAs the instructor and assistants for this course, we are committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
