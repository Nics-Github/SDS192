## Blog Posts

Blog posts should be in paragraphs, not one big wall of text.

Please double check your rendered assignment before submitting.

In markdown hit enter to make a new paragraph.

## Comments

Comments on code are missing. You should have a brief comment for each block of code describing what important [findings](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#comments) you have in your code. You can also describe what you are doing if your code is unclear.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Create plot 1 here
ggplot(data = scorecard, aes(x = pctfloan)) + #Accessing scorecard data, setting 'pctfloan' as the X-axis variable
  geom_histogram() + #Making a histogram to show the distribution
  labs(x = "Percent of Undergraduates Receiving Federal Loans",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Percentage of Undergraduates Receiving Federal Loans at Massachusetts Institutions",
       subtitle = "Source: MA College Scorecard Data") + #Adding labels and the data source to the plot
theme_minimal() #Adding the theme
```

## Default Colors

Pretty please do not use default colors. I will take off points for default colors going forward. (grey is okay)

## Year of data

Adding the year the data is from. This data is reproduced every year. If you do not provide a year the data is from it is annoying to reproduce your research.

## Confusing labels

Make the labels and scale match. Don't say 'percent' then show ratios or proportions.
