# My Project 3

## Q: Is the average rating for chain hamburgers better than local hamburgers ?

```{sql connection=db}

SHOW TABLES;

```

```{sql connection=db}

DESCRIBE businesses;

```

```{sql connection=db}

SELECT  *
FROM businesses
ORDER BY name;
```

The average of 154 chain brands is 3.1

```{sql connection=db}

SELECT  AVG(stars)
FROM businesses
WHERE name  IN ('Burger King','Wendys','Wendy''s','McDonald''s','Mc Donalds','Mc Donald''s', 'McDonalds','Five Guys','FiveGuys','Wendy''s Old Fashioned Hamburgers','In-N-Out Burger','Five Guys Burgers & Fries','Five Guys Burgers and Fries','In N Out Burger','Five Guys Burger and Fries','Smashburger','Red Robin Gourmet Burgers');
```

Average of 86 locations that had the word burger in their name but were not chain brands was 3.8.

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT name, AVG(stars)
FROM businesses
WHERE name  LIKE '%burger%'
GROUP BY name;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT city, AVG(stars)
FROM businesses
WHERE name  LIKE '%burger%' AND name NOT IN ('Burger King','Wendys','Wendy''s','McDonald''s','Mc Donalds','Mc Donald''s', 'McDonalds','Five Guys','FiveGuys','Wendy''s Old Fashioned Hamburgers','In-N-Out Burger','Five Guys Burgers & Fries','Five Guys Burgers and Fries','In N Out Burger','Five Guys Burger and Fries','Smashburger','Red Robin Gourmet Burgers') AND city LIKE 'phoenix'
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city ;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT  city, AVG(stars)
FROM businesses
WHERE name  IN ('Burger King','Wendys','Wendy''s','McDonald''s','Mc Donalds','Mc Donald''s', 'McDonalds','Five Guys','FiveGuys','Wendy''s Old Fashioned Hamburgers','In-N-Out Burger','Five Guys Burgers & Fries','Five Guys Burgers and Fries','In N Out Burger','Five Guys Burger and Fries','Smashburger','Red Robin Gourmet Burgers') AND city LIKE 'phoenix'
