## Instructor work-life balance {#work-life-balance}

-   I will respond to Slack messages sent during the week within 24h. I will respond to Slack messages sent during the weekend at my own discretion.
-   If possible, please only Slack me with briefer and administrative questions; I prefer having more substantive conversations in person as it takes me less energy to understand where you are at.
-   I will do my best to return all grading as promptly as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How can I succeed in this class?

Ask yourself:

-   **When I have questions or don't understand something:**
    -   *"Am I asking questions in class?"*
    -   *"Am I asking questions on Slack in the `#questions` channel?"* Even better: *"Am I answering my peers' questions on Slack?"*
    -   *"Having I been going to the Spinelli tutoring center for help on R and the tidyverse?"*
    -   *"Have I been coming to office hours?"*
-   **Lectures and readings:**
    -   *"Am I staying on top Slack notifications sent between lectures?"* If you need help developing a notification strategy that best suits your lifestyle, please speak to me.
    -   *"Am I attending lectures consistently?"*
    -   *"During in-class activities, am I actually running code line-by-line and studying the outputs, or am I just going through the motions?"*
    -   *"During in-class exercises, am I taking full advantage that I'm in the same place at the same time with the instructor, the lab assistants, and most importantly your peers, or am I browsing the web/texting the whole time?"*
    -   *"Have I been doing the associated readings for each lecture?"*

# Course Description & Objectives

An introduction to data science using Python, R and SQL. Students learn how to scrape, process and clean data from the web; manipulate data in a variety of formats; contextualize variation in data; construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques; visualize multidimensional data; design accurate, clear and appropriate data graphics; create data maps and perform basic spatial analysis; and query large relational databases. SDS 100 is required for students who have not previously completed SDS 201, SDS 220, SDS 290 or SDS 291.

**4 Class Hours 4 Credits**

# Lecture schedule

The lecture schedule and associated readings can be found on the [main page](https://nics-github.github.io/MTH_190_Intro_to_DS/) of this course webpage.

# Book and software

The Modern Data Science with R **textbook** is accessible on the navigational bar of this webpage as well as via [this link](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/). Students will use the HCC RStudio workbench to do computations in R find it [here](http://hcc-rstudiosrv1.hcc.edu:8787/s/93126cfc78a31806f480a/auth-sign-in?appUri=%2F).

# Class norms {#policies}

-   You are expected to stay until the end of lecture. If you need to leave early, please confirm with me at the beginning of lecture and sit somewhere where your departure will be minimally disruptive.
-   *Attendance policy.* You may be dropped from the course for missing 3 or more days of class.
-   Attendance will not be explicitly taken and occasional absences are excused. However, extended absences should be mentioned to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Readings

We'll be reading chapters 1-6,8,15,and 17 of Modern Data Science with R. 

# Evaluation

All due dates can be found on the [main page](https://nics-github.github.io/MTH_190_Intro_to_DS/) of this course webpage.

This class is project based. As such your evaluations will be based on projects you create.

## Projects 40%

There are four projects to complete during the semester.

## Final project 20%

There will be a final project due the last day of classes. You'll complete this final project over the course of the semester using a process called SCRUM. The Final Project will also have in groups of 2-3 where you can choose your groupmates.

## Problem sets 25%

Homework will be assigned regularly, its important to complete and stay on top of homework.

## Engagment 15% {#engagement}

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get out of this class as much as you put in*. That being said, here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged in this class:

-   In particular: Peer evaluations for all projects.
-   Asking and answering questions in class.
-   Working and staying focused in class.
-   Coming to office hours.
-   Posting questions on Slack.
-   Even better: Responding to questions on Slack.

## Tentative Assignment schedule

Homework Will be assigned weekly and due by midnight the following Monday.

Project 1- due after reading chapter 4 of MDSR roughly the 10th day of class

Project 2- due after reading chapter 5 of MDSR roughly the 18th day of class

Project 3- due after reading chapter 15 of MDSR roughly the 22nd day of class

Project 4- due after reading chapter 17 of MDSR roughly the 26th day of class

Final Project/ Presentation during our final time.

For a more up to date schedule see the course's [website](https://nics-github.github.io/MTH_190_Intro_to_DS/).

## Policies

1.  **Collaboration**: While I encourage you to work with your peers for problem sets, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged in your submissions.
