## Names and Surveys

## Data Viz no computers

[Sheets data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9srZXDoYzKGew1f-y4brMbN8dl4QM66pc-dmCBWHQY/edit?usp=sharing)

-   Data Frame

-   Observations

-   Tidy Data

-   Variables

-   Variable Types

## Take 1: Hand drawn graphs of survey questions.

Draw a graph of a variable. **Do not write your name.**

-   It does not need to be perfect.

-   Try to make it correct.

    -   It is fine if its not correct.

## Talk to someone close to you.

Answer these questions:

1.  Is the graph's message or story clear?

2.  What is missing from each graph?

3.  What is distracting from the graph?

4.  What does the graph do well?

## What makes a clear graph?

Class discussion.

## [A misleading chart from Apple](https://qz.com/122921/the-chart-tim-cook-doesnt-want-you-to-see/)

## Pie charts

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r mtcars-stacked-bar, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
g <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = am, fill = factor(cyl))) +
geom_bar(position = "fill") +
coord_flip() +
xlab("Percentage of Cars") +
ylab("Transmission Type (manual or automatic)") +
scale_fill_discrete("Cylinders")
g

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r mtcars-pie-chart, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5}

g + 
 aes(x = factor(1)) + 
 coord_polar(theta = "y") + 
 scale_x_discrete(NULL) + 
 facet_wrap(~am)

```

Are 6-cylinder engines more common among manuals or automatics?

## Unclear Scales

![](https://infovis-wiki.net/w/images/0/05/Lie_factor_example1_image.jpg){fig-align="center" width="200%"}

-   Often not very clearly defined
-   Easy to lie by manipulating scales
-   Why perspective?
-   Width of lines?

## Clearer Scales

![](http://images.slideplayer.com/14/4403460/slides/slide_21.jpg){fig-align="center"}

-   Good graphics have clear scales
    -   Remember iPhone sales graphic

## Balance of art vs. science

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Data graphics:

-   purpose is to convey meaning

-   scientific, rigorous

-   peer-reviewed

-   clear

-   **creative!**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Infographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic):

-   purpose might be to draw eyeballs

-   entertaining?

-   sales or marketing?

-   public sphere

-   creative

We're only interested in the former
