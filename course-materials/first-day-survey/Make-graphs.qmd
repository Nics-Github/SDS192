Hopefully I have summarized our survey data into a table.

# Your assignment is to draw a graph representing this data.

-   Make the best one you can. Do not include your names.

-   We will break into groups of four by convenience.

-   Your group will select the favorite graph from another group.

-   We will look at favorites as a class and discuss.

## Q: What is the purpose of a visualization?

## Q: What makes a successful graph?
