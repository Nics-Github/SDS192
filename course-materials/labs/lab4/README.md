# Lab Set-up

This lab comes from my colleague Lindsy Poirier. She ran it in Fall 2022. Here are her [instructions](https://sds-192-intro-fall22.github.io/sds-192-public-website-quarto/labs/lab5.html). Note that while she made the vizualization at the end optional, it is required for this course. 

1. Once you've opened this repo via the GitHub classroom link, copy and paste the URL. Then head over to RStudio.
2. In RStudio, click File > New Project > Version Control > Git
3. In the window that appears, paste the URL that you copied in the last step into the ‘Repository URL’ box.
4. Where it says ‘Create project as subdirectory of:’, make sure you store this project in the SDS 192 folder.
5. Click ‘Create Project.’
6. Open the .qmd files to complete the lab.
