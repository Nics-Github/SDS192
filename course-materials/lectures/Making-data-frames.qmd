# Weather

# Vectors

Make three vectors with the day of the month, the weather and temperature.

```{r}
day <- c(9, 10,11,12,13,14,15)
weather <- c()
temperature <- c()
```

# Uniqueness

```{r}
unique()
unique(weather)
```

# Make a dataframe

```{r}
Week_in_sept <- data.frame(day,weather,temperature)
```

# Let's take a look

```{r}
Week_in_sept

```

-   glimpse(Week_in_sept)

-   head(): returns first 6 rows

-   tails(): returns last 6 rows

-   names(): returns the coloumn names

-   
nrow(): returns the number of rows

-   ncol(): returns the number of columns

# Renaming columns

Save the new column names as a vector and use the names() function.

Weekdays \<- c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday"....)

names(Week_in_sept) \<- Weekdays

# Columns 

We can use the \$ to access columns as vectors `Week_in_sept$Monday`

Let's do `table()` on Monday

# A dataset

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)

Columns are variables

Rows are observations

Individual entries are called values

The data we will deal with in this course is rectangular.

# Metadata

This is the data about our data.

Sometimes a data dictionary comes with our data.

When data comes in a package we can use the `?` operator.

Metadata deals with provenance.

Descriptive Data deals with the contents of the data.

Let's consider `ChickWeight` and its metadata
