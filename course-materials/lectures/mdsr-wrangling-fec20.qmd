## `fec20`: the elections

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(fec20)
```

`candidates`: master table of \~5,000 candidates

    -   e.g., `BIDEN, JOSEPH R JR / HARRIS, KAMALA D.`

`committees`: master table of \~17,000 committees

    -   ## e.g., `TRUMP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN COMMITTEE`


Link to [committee types](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/committee-type-code-descriptions/) 





## `fec20`: the money

`pac`: **Summary** of PAC activity ~12,000 rows

Sampled data: 1,000 records each

-   contributions
-   individuals
-   expenditures
-   transactions

contributions: Contributions from committees to candidates \~500,000 transactions

## How is the data relational?

## {background-image="https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec20/raw/main/inst/fec20-dm.jpeg"}

## For un sampled Data

-   Need to fetch full results with `read_all_contributions()`
-   Can be **for or against** candidate!

**You should probably just ignore the other tables!!**

## Ex: Who "gave" to Biden?

```{r echo =TRUE}
library(fec20)
biden_id <- candidates %>%
  filter(
    cand_election_yr == 2020, 
    cand_pty_affiliation == "DEM", 
    str_detect(cand_name, "BIDEN")
  ) %>%
  pull(cand_id)
biden_id
```

## Ex: Who "gave" to Biden? (cont'd)

```{r echo=TRUE}
contributions %>%
  filter(cand_id == biden_id) %>%
  group_by(cmte_id) %>%
  summarize(
    num_transactions = n(),
    total = sum(transaction_amt)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  left_join(committees, by = "cmte_id") %>%
  select(num_transactions, total, cmte_nm)
```

## Huh?

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
contributions %>%
  filter(cand_id == biden_id) %>%
  group_by(cmte_id, transaction_tp) %>%    #<<
  summarize(.groups = "drop",
    num_transactions = n(),
    total = sum(transaction_amt)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  left_join(committees, by = "cmte_id") %>%
  select(transaction_tp, num_transactions, total, cmte_nm)
```

## Corporate contributions

Is there a way to view the monetary values of contributions not made by individuals?

-   I don't know.
    You may be referring to ["dark money"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money)

-   Corporations can't donate "hard money"

-   [Citizen's Brochure](https://transition.fec.gov/pages/brochures/citizens.shtml)

-   [Who can and can't contribute](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/who-can-and-cannot-contribute/)


## Missing data

-   Why are employer and occupation all **empty** in contributions dataset?
-   It happens in `cand_id` in committees dataset as well.
-   Lots of **data is missing** from the dataset and the labels are defiantly more confusing than other datasets in terms of what the categories are labeled.

-   That's what real data is like

## Committees?

It doesn't say to whom the various individuals made the donations to, is there a way we can find that out?

-   individuals don't give to candidates, they give to committees

-   committees spend on behalf of or against candidates

-   use `cmte_id` and `cand_id` to link tables

-   note that `contributions` table has **both**

[different types of committees](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/committee-type-code-descriptions/)

## Negative amounts?

In the individuals and transactions data, how were some of the transaction amounts negative or zero?

-   donations can be [returned](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/taking-receipts-political-party/refunds-contributions/)

-   Pay attention to [`transaction_type` codes](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/transaction-type-code-descriptions/):

    -   `24A`: Independent expenditure **opposing** election of candidate
    -   `24E`: Independent expenditure **advocating** election of candidate
