## Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Recall Variable Types

Categorical Variables in R are called:

-   Character variables

-   Factors

Numeric Variables in R are called:

-   Integer

-   Double

## Create Histograms

To see the spread, center and shape of a numeric variable.

```{r}
mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x= mpg )) +
  geom_historgram()
```

## Histograms

1.  Make bins for the numbers
2.  Counts the occurrence of a value within bins
3.  The height is the number of counts.

We can adjust the bin or bin size.

## Create Bargraph

Visualize the counts of a categorical variable

```{r}
library(openintro)
loans50
```

## Create Facets
