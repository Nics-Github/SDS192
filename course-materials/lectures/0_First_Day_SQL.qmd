# Setup

# Big Idea

Data can live in a flat file (.csv) or relational database.

If the file is too big it wont fit into the computer's memory and the software may crash.

Often data is stored in a database on a server and called up on demand.

To do this we use the Structured Query Language (SQL).

# Dialects of SQL

There are SQL, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and others.

# SQL is old

IT was developed in the 1970s by IBM, but is still in use and important for data science

[Here are the 2024 programming language rankings.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024)

# SQL-Practice

We'll use this SQL practice to get started.

https://www.sql-practice.com/

# The Database db

Here there are two small databases.

1.  hospitals.db
2.  northwind.db

We'll focus on hospitals.

# Tables (Data Frames)

There are four tables in hospitals.

They are related, we can see the relationship using the schema.

Most databases are relational.

# Variable Types

-   Categorical

    -   SQL: Text, CHAR

-   Numeric

    -   SQL: DATE, INT

[There are more,](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp) but they all fall under Categorical or Numeric.

# SQL commands

| SQL      | dplyr                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| SELECT   | Choose a column...                      |
| FROM     | ...the data frame                       |
| WHERE    | A condition on a variable               |
| GROUP BY | Subset the data for computation         |
| HAVING   | A condition on grouped variables        |
| ORDER BY | Used to arrange the data (use DESC too) |
| LIMIT    | Shows only the first so many rows       |
| COUNT    | Used with Select to count rows          |
| IS NULL  | Used when searching for missing values  |

# Example 1

How many doctors are there?

# Answer 1

We can probably just count the data to answer this.

But we can also do

```         


SELECT COUNT(doctor_id)
FROM doctors
```

# Example 2

How many cardiologists are there? What are their names?

# Answer 2

We can count them, but if there were lots of doctors at several hospitals this would be hard.

```         


SELECT 
first_name, 
last_name
FROM doctors
WHERE specialty = "Cardiologist"
```

# Like and Wild cards

You can use a combination of the command LIKE and a wild card % to answer the question above.

```         


SELECT 
first_name, 
last_name
FROM doctors
WHERE specialty LIKE "Card%"
```

# Example 3

Who is the oldest patient?

# Answer 3a

Here we can order the data (or use the min function to find the earliest date).

```         


SELECT 
birth_date, 
first_name, 
last_name
FROM patients
order by birth_date
```

# Answer 3b

```         

SELECT 
min(birth_date), 
first_name, 
last_name
FROM patients
```

# Practice

There are some built in problems on this platform.

# Why use R?

We use R because SQL is good for looking up data, but not for visualizing it, creating custom functions, building websites to show off our work or machine learning.

R is good at these things.
