# Pushing to Main

We've seen how messy this can get.

You can push to main when you are working one (and always on one computer).

# Branches

When working with other people create branches.

Branches allow you to work without mucking up other's work.

What if two people were working on the same line of code at the same time and pushed to main?

Github doesn't know which to take and you get a tricky merge conflict.

# Step 1: Create a fresh project 1 .rproj file.

You can save your .qmd if you've been working on it.

We'll get it it later.

# Step 2: Create a new branch.

Pay attention to the website for pull requests.

### Give it a good name.

Your partner is doing the same thing.

# Step 3: Change a small thing.

We will change the author's name in our project.

Work out with your partner who is author 1 and 2. Reverse Alphabetical is my fav.

# Step 4: Save and commit.

Your partners are doing the same thing.

# Step 5: Pull then Push your branch to github.

In general its a good idea to pull first to get any new changes before you push.

# Step 6: Go to that website from step 2.
