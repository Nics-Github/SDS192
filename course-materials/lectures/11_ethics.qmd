## Privacy

Who will have access to data that can be used to ID a person?

How will individuals be anonymized?

Who has access to that anonymized data.

## Scenario 

A citizen of a country files taxes with their government. Paying taxes is rarely optional. In filing there are data related to residence, wages, age, gender, taxes and government ID numbers pertaining to this citizen and their family.

Discuss:

-   Provenance

-   Purpose

-   Protection

-   Preparation

-   Privacy

## Government's responsibility 

Who should access to this data?

How should is be secured?

What rights to privacy does this citizen have?

How long should the data be held?
