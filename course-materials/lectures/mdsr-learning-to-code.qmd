::: {.column width="50%"}

- use `ggplot2` in your searches

- use [`ggplot2` tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2)

- beware of base R and `lattice` solutions
    - ~~`plot()`~~
    - ~~`xyplot()`~~

## Don't blindly copy and paste code


- Coding is a [form of expression](https://femgineer.com/2012/09/software-engineering-another-form-of-self-expression/)

- It's like taking notes

- Write it yourself from scratch

- **Don't submit code that you don't understand**

## Bad filenames

- Problems: 
    - spaces and special characters in filenames are bad
    - file extensions are important

- Solutions:
    - use underscores (`_`) and/or dashes (`-`)
    - use `.Rmd`

## When you need to clean up...

- Broom icon in Environment to sweep away objects

- Run all chunks above
    - `Ctrl + Alt + P`

- `Session` -> `Restart R`



## Navigating R help

- Will come with experience

- R help:
    - rigorously formatted
    - often incomplete
    - often complete but inscrutable
    - examples can be hit-or-miss
    - argument descriptions are usually good
