This is started code intended to go with the example presented by Tim Martyn


```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
posted <- Sys.time() > "2020-11-25 11:00:00 EDT"
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# do NOT install RMySQL if you are on the RStudio Server
install.packages("RMySQL")
```

## Connecting to MySQL

The data we will be using is stored on a server in Bass Hall. It's called `scidb.smith.edu`. We can connect through the `dbConnect()` function provided by the `DBI` package (which is loaded automatically when you load `RMySQL`). You will also need the `RMySQL` package installed. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RMySQL)


db <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(),
  host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "sds192",
  password = "DSismfc@S",
  dbname = "imdb"
  )
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection= 'db', max.print = 5)
```
