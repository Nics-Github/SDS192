## Why R?

The top three languages in Data Science right now are:

-   Python (pandas, numpy, pytorch)

-   R (tidyverse)

-   SQL

    Probably in that order.

## Interchangeable

Learning how to work with data is similar from on language to another.

R, I think, is the most convenient way to get students working with Data.

For vizualization: the ggplot ecosystem is nicer than pandas.

The RStudio and R work very well together.

# A short history of R.

See [this site](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html) for a longer history with fewer pictures.

## Before R there was S

"S is a language that was developed \[in 1976\] by John Chambers and others at the old Bell Telephone Laboratories"

## S got bought and sold

TIBCO is the owner of S

Here's a book on S

## 1996-2000 R is released for free

Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman of the university of Auckland Developed it.

# Why is it called R?

## CRAN

Comprehensive R Archive Network

They manage all R updates and R packages. There are currently 19897 packages.

They put on the UseR! conference

There's an R magazine

[This is the CRAN team](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## The tidyverse

Hadley Wickham and others made it.

## Who makes RStudio?

::: incremental
-   Started in 2009 as RStudio

-   The tidyverse comes out in 2016

-   Renamed Posit last year.

-   Offers Python, SQL, and other DS language Support
:::

## Deep Learning and AI

[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is becoming increasingly an increasingly popular method for deep learning in python.

R has [torch](https://torch.mlverse.org/), which is an implementation of pytorch in R.

## The future

Posit has made a pivot toward integrating Python and Jupyter into their ecosystem with Quarto.

Quarto is a document that works with Python, R, and other languges.

[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) is an IDE independent of language forked from VS code.
