Problem 1 (Easy): Consider the following data graphic.

Q: The am variable takes the value 0 if the car has automatic transmission and 1 if the car has manual transmission. How could you differentiate the cars in the graphic based on their transmission type?

A: set color = am

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp,mpg,color=am)) +
  geom_point()
```
