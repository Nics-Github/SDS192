```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(RMySQL)

con <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(), host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "waiuser", password = "smith_waiDB", 
  dbname = "wai"
)
Measurements <- tbl(con, "Measurements")
```

Problem 1 (Easy): How many rows are available in the Measurements table of the Smith College Wideband Auditory Immittance database?

There are 4,203,645 rows available.

```{sql connection=con}
DESCRIBE Measurements;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS N
FROM Measurements;
```
