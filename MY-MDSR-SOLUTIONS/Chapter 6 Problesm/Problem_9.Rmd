```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(babynames)

```

This is a difficult problem, I have not finished this problem. 

```{r}
?make_babynames_dist()
glimpse(babynames)
```

```{r}
make_babynames_dist() %>%
  filter(name == "Nicholas")
  
?lifetables

lifetables
```

```{r}

my_make_baby_names_function <-function(){
  babynames %>%
    #group_by(name,year) %>%
    mutate(x = 2014-year) %>% #I'm making an age variable so I can do a join with "lifetables"
    left_join(lifetables,by = c("year","sex"))
    
  
}
my_make_baby_names_function() %>%
  filter(name=="Nicholas")

```
