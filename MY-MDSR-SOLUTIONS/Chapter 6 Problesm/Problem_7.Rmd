```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(mosaicData)


```

```{r}
#Make the table

ds1 <- data.frame(
  id=c(1,2,3,1,2,3),
  group=c("T","T","T","C","C","C"),
  vals= c(4,6,8,5,6,10))
ds1

```

```{r}
#This is copied from the text
Treat <- filter(ds1, group == "T")
Control <- filter(ds1, group == "C")
all <- mutate(Treat, diff = Treat$vals - Control$vals)
all
```

Problems that might arrise: 
1. If data is missing for an id you'll get NA and not be able to calculate the difference.
2. If the ids are out of order( currently they are 1,2,3,1,2,3) They will not calculate the correct difference. 

```{r my_pivot_wider_solution}
#This makes  the column names from the group variable, mutate adds the difference column. 
ds1 %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = "group", 
  values_from = "vals") %>%
  mutate(diff=T - C)
```
