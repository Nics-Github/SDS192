```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(lubridate)

```

Problem 1 (Easy): In the Marriage data set included in mosaic, the appdate, ceremonydate, and dob variables are encoded as factors, even though they are dates. Use lubridate to convert those three columns into a date format.

```{r}
#This is from the texbook

Marriage %>%
  select(appdate, ceremonydate, dob) %>%
  glimpse(width = 50)

```

#I am alittle confused by this problem. It seems like the appdate , ceremonydate, etc. are already dates. Also the years for the dob must be wrong. 

```{r}

Marriage %>%
  mutate(
    appdate_date = ymd(appdate),
    ceremonydate_date = ymd(ceremonydate),
    dob_date = ymd(dob)
  )

```
