Problem 9 (Medium): Using the penguins data set from the palmerpenguins package:

Create a scatterplot of bill_length_mm against bill_depth_mm where individual species are colored and a regression line is added to each species. Add regression lines to all of your facets. What do you observe about the association of bill depth and bill length?

```{r}
ggplot(data=penguins,aes(bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm,color=species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
```


Repeat the same scatterplot but now separate your plot into facets by species. How would you summarize the association between bill depth and bill length.

```{r}
ggplot(data=penguins,aes(bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(cols = vars(species))+
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE)
```
