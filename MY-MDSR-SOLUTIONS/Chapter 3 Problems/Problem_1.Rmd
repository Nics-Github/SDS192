Problem 1 (Easy): Angelica Schuyler Church (1756â€“1814) was the daughter of New York Governer Philip Schuyler and sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. Angelica, New York was named after her. Using the babynames package generate a plot of the reported proportion of babies born with the name Angelica over time and interpret the figure.

```{r Angelica-name-plot}
#This uses the filter verb, which the students need for most of the chapter 3 problems. 

babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Angelica") %>% #Filter for only the names Angelica
  ggplot( aes(year,prop))+
  geom_point()          #I think this is the plot that the question is asking for. 
```



```{r Angelica-baby-names-suming-gender}
#This chunk uses filter verbs that are not cover until chapter 4, but demonstrates how to combine male and female Angelica babies. 

Angelica <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Angelica") %>% #Filter for only the names Angelica
  group_by(year) %>%            #Group by year to combine both male and female births
  mutate(total_gender_prop = sum(prop))  #This should sum the proportion of male and female births
  

Angelica %>%
  ggplot(aes(year,total_gender_prop))+
  geom_point()      
```
