```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)
library(nasaweather)
```

Problem 2 (Easy): Using data from the nasaweather package, create a scatterplot between wind and pressure, with color being used to distinguish the type of storm.

```{r wind-v-pressure}
ggplot(storms,aes(wind,pressure,color=type)) +   #Just plotting some storm data
  geom_point()    
```
