```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)
library(macleish)
```

I cannot get the sf packages to install correctly. I cannot do this problem on Linux, but I can on Windows. 

```{r}
ggplot(whately_2015, aes(when, temperature))+
  #geom_point()
  geom_line()
```
